# Payton's Spotify Data

### Project organization
This project uses TechnicalReport.ipynb as the main source of content; utils.py assists in code for the notebook. The .csv files are also displayed to show raw data input as well as the cleaned data.

### Running the Project
Place your JSON streaming history into the "StreamingHistoryJsonFiles" in order to load into seperate dataframes. The data will be concatenated into one dataframe "spot_df", which will finally be cleaned and sent to "cleanspotifydata.csv". From here, the project can be run to analyze the data.
